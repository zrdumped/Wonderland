# Wonderland
A simulation game designed to improve the communication between left-behind children and their parents.


## Design & Mechanism
This game was designed for a hackathon activity held by Target which aimed at improve their factory workers' communication with their children who are left behind in their hometown (rural areas).

The main purpose of this game is to "create topics". It can be devided into 3 parts.
### Decorate the Home Together
We create a home and some furniture which can be moved, rotates, added or deleted. The family members can share their imaginations about their ideal house and decorate it together.

### Leave a Puzzle
The parents can bring new furniture into their warehouse with some specific steps. They should firstly choose the furniture, and record their description of it. Then the box containing the furniture will be sent to their house waits to be opened.

### Open the Gift
The children can open the box, but can not take out the gift easily. They should observe the gift with a flashlight in a dark scene within limited time. The record will be played at the same time. Then multiple similar furnitures will be showed but only one of them is the one chosen by his parents. Only if the child choose the right one can he put it in their warehouse.
